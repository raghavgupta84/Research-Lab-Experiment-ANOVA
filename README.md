# Research-Lab-Experiment-ANOVA

## Problem Statement:
A research laboratory was developing a new compound for the relief of severe cases of hay fever. In an experiment with 36 volunteers, the amounts of the two active ingredients (A & B) in the compound were varied at three levels each. Randomization was used in assigning four volunteers to each of the nine treatments. The data on hours of relief can be found in the following .csv file: Fever.csv. Analyse the effects of one variable on another with the help of an interaction plot. What is the interaction between the two treatments?
Perform a two-way ANOVA based on the different ingredients (variable ‘A’ & ‘B’ along with their interaction 'A*B') with the variable 'Relief' and state your results.
